## About Me

I work at the intersection of IT support, hardware integration, and creative technology. My background spans high-volume lab environments, embedded systems prototyping, and interactive software development — from maintaining fabrication systems across thousands of jobs to building VR training tools and shipping games at hackathons.

I'm especially interested in enterprise IT infrastructure, operational reliability, and the systems that quietly power mission-driven organizations.
